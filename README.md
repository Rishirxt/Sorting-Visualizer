📖 Overview
Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive React application that brings sorting algorithms to life through animated visualizations. This educational tool helps developers and students understand how different sorting algorithms work by watching them in action.

🚀 Features
🔢 Supported Algorithms
Bubble Sort - Simple comparison-based algorithm

Selection Sort - In-place comparison sorting

Insertion Sort - Builds sorted array one item at a time

Merge Sort - Efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm

🎮 Interactive Controls
Real-time Visualization - Watch elements sort with color-coded indicators

Play/Pause/Stop - Full control over the sorting process

Dynamic Array Generation - Create new random arrays of varying sizes

Speed Control - Adjust visualization speed

🎨 Visual Indicators
Blue - Unsorted elements

Dark Blue - Elements being compared

Green - Sorted elements in correct position

Number Labels - Clear value representation on each bar

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend Framework: React 18.2.0

Styling: CSS3 with modern glassmorphism effects

Build Tool: Create React App

Deployment: Vercel

Version Control: Git & GitHub

📦 Installation
Prerequisites
